class_name Quiz
## A convenience implementation for creating dialogues as quizzes.
##
## [Quiz] utilizes [Dialog] and [Dialog.Sequence], alongside a uniquely shaped
## configuration [Dictionary], to simplify the process of creating dialogue-based
## quizzes. In addition to a configuration, a [Quiz] constructor can accept a second
## [Dictionary] where you can define the phrases for the start and end [Dialog]s
## as well as boilerplate responses for choosing a "correct" or "wrong" answer.
## [br][br]Quiz configurations must only have top-level-keys in the form [code]qx[/code]
## where 'x' is a number greater than 0. The key [code]q1[/code] will always be the first question.
## Answers will be shown in a random order every time the quiz is generated. You may provide
## a [code]speaker[/code] or [code]using_typing[/code] property in any question to function
## as would be expected from a [Dialog.Sequence] configuration.
## [br][br]Configuration example:
##		[codeblock]
##		const config := {
##		    "q1": {
##		        "speaker": "Mother",
##		        "using_typing": true,
##		        "question": "What is 2+2?",
##		        "correct": 4,
##		        "wrong": [3, 5, 21]
##		    }
##		}
##		[/codeblock]
## [br][br]The values provided for the "question", "correct", and "wrong" properties must be castable
## as [String]. "wrong" must be an array. "question" will be displayed in your "dialogue" [Node] while
## "correct" and "wrong" will be displayed together as options for the generated "question" [Dialog].
## [br]If you want to add custom dialogue to display after clicking a given answer, simply add a [Dictionary]
## in place of the answer as so:
##		[codeblock]
##		const config := {
##		    "q1": {
##		        ...,
##		        "correct": {
##		            "option": 4,
##		            "phrases": ["The answer is 4 because 2 two times is 4."]
##		        },
##		        "wrong": [3, {
##		            "option": 5,
##		            "phrases": ["The actual answer is 4."]
##		        }, 21]
##		    }
##		}
##		[/codeblock]
## [br] Note that you may mix in [Dictionary]s for your answers as desired and that anything defined in the
## "phrases" property will be displayed [b]after[/b] the boilerplate response, if provided.

## [Dialog]-specific properties that should be applied from the provided configuration.
## [br]These are properties that may propagate between [Dialog]s as defined in [Dialog] and [Dialog.Sequence].
