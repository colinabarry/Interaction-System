## [Dialog] is a node intended to be used in a [Dialog.Sequence], not alone, to manage
## dialogue-based interactions. So long as the [member phrases] property is populated,

## are not set and this [Dialog] was preceeded by another [Dialog] in a [Dialog.Sequence],
## then those properties will propagate to this one.
## You may optionally define lifecycle events.
