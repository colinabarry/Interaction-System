			"Rehabilitation is crucial for regaining strength and mobility in your knee. We'll work together to develop a personalized program designed just for you.",
			"Our primary goals will be to reduce pain, improve range of motion, and strengthen your leg muscles to better support your knee joint.",
			"Throughout your rehab journey, we'll focus on exercises that target your quadriceps, hamstrings, and core muscles. It's important to be patient and consistent with your progress.",
			"Before we begin, let's do a quick assessment of your current knee function. This will help us tailor the exercises to your specific needs and monitor your improvement.",
			"Now, let's get started with some gentle warm-ups and stretches. Remember, it's essential to communicate any discomfort or concerns during your sessions. We're here to support you every step of the way!"

			"Of course, jumping isn't the concern. How you land from your jump is what causes injury, which is why we want to make sure you're always prepared with proper posture."
